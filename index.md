This interactive map shows youth incarceration data by LAPD division.

This analysis was performed by Marlborough student Isabelle S. '21 as part of
the Honors CS Projects course, in collaboration with the Liberty Hill
Foundation.  Isabelle did the data analysis in Python, and wrote the
interactive map code in Processing.  This is a p5.js version of the Processing
code.
